## Emotive Droid from IBM Research

Showing how to intelligently animate a 3D model using Watson Speech to Text & Tone Analyser

### Technologies used:

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/)
* [Watson for Unity](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/unity-sdk)
* [Watson Speech to Text](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/)
* [Watson Tone Analyser](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/)

### Project
This project uses Watson SDK for Unity to invoke multiple cloud based watosn AI systems. First is uses [Watson Speech to Text](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/) to detect **when** you are talking, and then **what** you are saying.

Using this it then runs the text though [Watson Tone Analyser](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/) This allows us to pick up the **emotional content** of the speech ( Joy/Sadness/Anger/Fear/Disgust). Importantly we can also understand how **confident** we are in this emotional content, we are confident, and express enough of the emotion, the Droid in our animation scene will then react to your emotions. 

### Getting Started

Coming Soon....
